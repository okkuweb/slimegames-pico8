# Slimegames notes
- Add skins for the characters
- Add epic anime cutscenes for when you hit the balls in a certain way. Eg. when you drop on the ball from the above.
- When pushing the opposite direction button it should override the already pushed direction
- Remember to fix the slime positions so that they're in identical positions

## Ball physics
- The speed is always constant defined number on hit
- The gravity is always constant
- At the start the gravity is 0
- Make sure that the ball speed is actually consistent at differing angles
- Implement the ball hitspeed. Now the speed of the ball operates on some magic. I don't even know.
