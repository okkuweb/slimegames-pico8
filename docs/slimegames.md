# Slimegames notes
- Add skins for the characters
- Add epic anime cutscenes for when you hit the balls in a certain way. Eg. when you drop on the ball from the above.
- When pushing the opposite direction button it should override the already pushed direction when moving the player
- Remember to fix the slime positions so that they're in identical positions

## Ball physics
- Hitting the ball should probably take into account the momentum of the player hitting it...?
- Fix the hitboxes so that the ball won't be hit if under the character... Somehow...
